Hangman is a game in which the player guesses a random word. The program reads words from a text file
into two-dimensional dynamic array and selects a word randomly, which can also have a preferred length.
The program tackles a variety of standard input behaviors, for example, the issue with an input being
more than one letter or mix of different character types. In the end, the program updates word-countduration triplets in a separate text file.
