This project converts benign and malware files into images, which can be used for training the malware detection CNN model. 
The robustness of the model against adversial samples is then improved using an existing but slightly modified algorithm. 
model2.h5 is the model that is achieved with training.py and used in adversial training.py.
img_list.npy and labels.npy are dataset files that are prepared by the script sample_prepare.py from the original raw dataset.
These files are available on request.
